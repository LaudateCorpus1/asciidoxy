== Inserting API reference

The original purpose of AsciiDoxy is to insert API reference documentation in AsciiDoc files. Use
the `${api.link("Api.insert", text="api.insert")}` method to insert API reference documentation at
the current location.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.insert(<name>,
             [kind=<kind>,]
             [lang=<language>,]
             [leveloffset]),
             [...]}
${api.insert_<kind>(<name>,                   # <1>
                    [lang=<language>,]
                    [leveloffset=<offset>]),
                    [...]}
"""}
----
<1> Alternative way to specify the `kind` of element to insert.

The `insert` method takes the following arguments:

`name`:: Name of the element to insert. This can be the fully qualified name, or if a <<_namespace>>
is set, a relative name.
`lang`:: Optional. Name of the programming language.
`kind`:: Optional. Kind of element to insert.
`leveloffset`:: Optional. Offset for the headers in the reference from the top level of the current
file. Defaults to +1. Provide `None` to not set the offset.

Trying to insert an unknown element will result in an error.

When not specifying the language and kind, AsciiDoxy will try to find the element by name, and
deduce the kind and language. If there are multiple matching elements, an error is raised.

You can add additional options. These options are added as attributes to the inserted include
directive for the API reference fragment. For available attributes see
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-directive[the AsciiDoctor manual].

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.insert("MyNamespace::MyClass")}                                    # <1>
${api.insert("com.tomtom.Class", leveloffset="+2")}                      # <2>
${api.insert("com.tomtom.Class", kind="class")}                          # <3>

${api.insert_function("MyNamespace::FreeFunction", lang="c++")}          # <6>
"""}
----
<1> Insert API reference for the element named `MyNamespace::MyClass`.
<2> Insert API reference for the element named `com.tomtom.Class` using an alternative level offset
    for the headers in the API reference.
<3> Insert API reference for the class named `com.tomtom.Class`. Elements of other types are
    ignored.
<4> Insert API reference for the {cpp} element named `MyNamespace::FreeFunction`. Other languages are
    ignored.
<5> Insert API reference for the class named `MyNamespace::MyClass`. Alternative syntax.
<6> Insert API reference for the {cpp} function named `MyNamespace::FreeFunction`. Alternative syntax.

=== Filtering what is inserted

By default `${api.link("Api.insert", text="api.insert")}` inserts all contents of the API element.
You can control which members, inner classes, enum values, and exceptions get inserted for each
call to `api.insert`.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.insert(...,
             [members=<filter_spec>,]
             [inner_classes=<filter_spec>,]
             [enum_values=<filter_spec>,]
             [exceptions=<filter_spec>])}
"""}
----

A filter specification is either a single string, a list of strings, or a dictionary.

A single string is the same as a list of strings with just one item.

A list of strings defines a set of regular expressions to be applied to the name. They are
applied in the order they are specified. If the element is still included after all filters
have been applied, it is inserted.

Each string can have the following value:
`NONE`:: Exclude all elements.
`ALL`:: Include all elements.
`<regular expression>` or `+<regular expression`:: Include elements that match the regular
expression.
`-<regular expression>`:: Exclude elements that match the regular expression.

If the first string is an include regular expression, an implicit `NONE` is prepended, if
the first string is an exclude regular expression, an implicit `ALL` is prepended.

Some filters support filtering on other properties than the name. By default they only
filter on the name. To filter the other properties use a dictionary, where the key is the
name of the property, and the value is a string or list of strings with the filter.

== Global filters

A global filter can be set that applies to every `api.insert` after it is set using
`${api.link("Api.filter", text="api.filter")}`.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.filter([members=<filter_spec>,]
             [inner_classes=<filter_spec>,]
             [enum_values=<filter_spec>,]
             [exceptions=<filter_spec>])}
"""}
----

The global filter applies to every call to `api.insert` in the same file, after it is set. It also
applies to any file included after it is set.

Filters can be overridden in included files. At the end of the file, the original filter is
restored.

=== Combining filter specifications

When an `api.insert` call contains additional filter specifications, these specifications are added
to the end of the global filter specifications:

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.filter(members=["add", "update"])}
${api.insert("name", members=["remove"])}

# Is equal to
${api.insert("name", members=["add", "update", "remove"])}
"""}
----

Filters added in `api.insert` are always added to the end. If there is no corresponding global
filter specification, it is treated as a new filter, and `NONE` or `ALL` is prepended if needed.


The global filter can be overridden for some calls to `api.insert`. Then only the explicit filter
specifications on that call are used:

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.insert(...,
             ignore_global_filter=True,
             [members=<filter_spec>,]
             [inner_classes=<filter_spec>,]
             [enum_values=<filter_spec>,]
             [exceptions=<filter_spec>])}
"""}
----

== Linking to API reference

Use `${api.link("Api.link", text="api.link")}` to insert a link to an API reference element.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.link(<name>,
           [kind=<kind>,]
           [lang=<language>,]
           [text=<alt_text>,]
           [full_name=<True/False>,]
           [allow_overloads=<True/False>])}
${api.link_<kind>(<name>,                     # <1>
                  [lang=<language>,]
                  [text=<alt_text>,]
                  [full_name=<True/False>,]
                  [allow_overloads=<True/False>])}
"""}
----
<1> Alternative way to specify the `kind` of element to link to.

By default the short name of the element is used as the text of the link.

`name`:: Fully qualified name of the element to insert.
`lang`:: Name of the programming language.
`kind`:: Kind of element to insert.
`text`:: Alternative text to use for the link.
`full_name`:: Use the fully qualified name of the referenced element.
`allow_overloads`:: True to link to the first match in an overload set.

A warning is shown if the element is unknown, or is not inserted in the same document using the
`insert` method. There is a command-line option to throw an error instead.

When not specifying the language and kind, AsciiDoxy will try to find the element by name, and
deduce the kind and language. If there are multiple matching elements, an error is raised.

=== Function or method overloads

In languages that support overloading functions, methods or other callables, the name alone is not
sufficient to select the correct element to link to or to insert. By default AsciiDoxy will create
a link to the first member of the overload. In case you need to link to a specific overload the
exact list of types of the parameters can be provided to select the right element.

The list of parameter types should be specified in parentheses after the function name:

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.link("MyFunction(int, std::string)")}
"""}
----

Empty parentheses indicate the function should accept no parameters:

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.link("MyFunction()")}
"""}
----

If no parentheses are given, the parameters are ignored. If there are multiple overloads, AsciiDoxy
will not be able to pick one:

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.link("MyFunction")}
"""}
----

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.link("MyNamespace::MyClass")}                            # <1>
${api.link("MyNamespace::MyClass", lang="c++")}                # <2>
${api.link("com.tomtom.Class.Method", full_name=True)}         # <3>
${api.link("MyNamespace::FreeFunction", text="FreeFunction")}  # <4>
${api.link_class("MyNamespace::MyClass")}                      # <5>
${api.link_class("MyNamespace::MyClass", lang="c++")}          # <6>
"""}
----
<1> Link to any element called `MyNamespace::MyClass`.
<2> Link to any {cpp} element called `MyNamespace::MyClass`. Other languages are ignored.
<3> Link to `com.tomtom.Class.Method` and use the fully qualified name for the link text.
<4> Link to `MyNamespace::FreeFunction` and use "FreeFunction" for the link text.
<5> Link to class `MyNamespace::MyClass`. Ignore other kinds of elements.
<6> Link to {cpp} class `MyNamespace::MyClass`. Ignore other kinds of elements and languages.

== Including other AsciiDoc files [[api_include]]

AsciiDoc has the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-directive[`include` directive] to
embed other AsciiDoc files in the current file. AsciiDoxy extends this directive with its
`${api.link("Api.include", text="api.include")}` method for 2 reasons:

. Perform preprocessing on the included AsciiDoc files. When using the normal `include` directive,
  AsciiDoxy will not preprocess the included file.
. Extend the include functionality, for example with multi-page support.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.include(<file_name>,
              [package_name=<package name>,]
              [leveloffset=<offset>,]
              [link_text=<text>,]
              [link_prefix=<prefix>,]
              [multipage_link=<bool>,]
              [always_embed=<bool>,]
              [...])}
"""}
----

`file_name`:: Relative or absolute path to the file to include.
`package_name`:: Package containing the file to include. Defaults to the current package.
`leveloffset`:: Offset for the headers in the included file from the top level of the current file.
Defaults to +1.

In single-page mode, the default, the file to include is preprocessed by AsciiDoxy. Then a normal
`include` directive is inserted pointing to the preprocessed file. This embeds the file in the same
output document.

In multi-page mode, the preprocessed file is not embedded. Instead, a separate output file is
generated, and a link to that file is inserted. The format of the link is controlled with additional
arguments:

`link_text`:: Text for the link to insert in multi-page mode.
`link_prefix`:: Text to insert before the link in multi-page mode. Use this to create for example a
numbered list of links.
`multipage_link`:: By default a link is inserted in multi-page mode. Set this to False to omit
inserting the link. The included file is still processed. Use <<cross_referencing>> to insert a
link elsewhere in the document.
`always_embed`:: Always embed the included file in the current document, even if multipage mode is
enabled.

You can add additional options. These options are added as attributes to the inserted include
directive for the API reference fragment. For available attributes see
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-directive[the AsciiDoctor manual].

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.include("component/reference.adoc")}                                           # <1>

${api.include("component/reference.adoc", link_text="Reference", link_prefix=". ")}  # <3>
${api.include("/component/reference.adoc", multipage_link=False)}                   # <4>
"""}
----
<1> Include and process `component/reference.adoc` relative to this file.
<2> Include and process `/mount/data/reference.adoc` as an absolute path to the file. Increase the
    level of the headers by 3.
<3> In multi-page mode use the link text "Reference" and prefix with a dot to create a numbered
    list. In single-page mode the document is embedded.
<4> In multi-page mode process the file, but do not create a link to it. In single page mode the
    document is embedded.

== Cross-referencing sections in other AsciiDoc files[[cross_referencing,cross referencing]]

In multi-page mode, normal https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#xref[cross references] to
anchors in included files do not work. A link to the appropariate file needs to be created. For this
there is `${api.link("Api.cross_document_ref", text="api.cross_document_ref")}`.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.cross_document_ref(<file_name>,
                         [package_name=<package name>,]
                         [anchor=<section-anchor>,]
                         [link_text=<text>])}

----

`file_name`:: File containing the anchor to link to.
`package_name`:: Package containing the file to link to. Defaults to the current package.
`anchor`:: Anchor to link to. If not provided, `link_text` is required.
`link_text`:: Text to use for the link. If not provided, the anchor name is used.

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.cross_document_ref("component/component_a.adoc", anchor="section-1")}  # <1>
${api.cross_document_ref("component/component_a.adoc", anchor="section 1",   # <2>
                         link_text="Component A - Section 1")}
"""}
----
<1> Insert a link with text "section-1".
<2> Insert a link with text "Component A - Section 1".

== Setting default programming language

When all documentation in a file is for the same programming language, you can set the default
language to use for every command using `${api.link("Api.language", text="api.language")}`.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.language(<language>)}
"""}
----

Other languages will be ignored, unless overridden with a `lang` argument. This setting also
applies to all files included afterwards, but resets and the end of the current file.

`language`:: Language to use as default, or `None` to reset.

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.language("cpp")}  # <1>
${api.language("c++")}  # <2>
${api.language("java")} # <3>
${api.language(None)}   # <4>
"""}
----
<1> Set the default language to {cpp}.
<2> Set the default language to {cpp}. Alternative language name.
<3> Set the default language to Java.
<4> Remove the default language.

== Transcoding

In some ecosystems multiple languages can be used together. Elements written in one language can
directly be used in the other language. The compiler or interpreter makes sure calls are translated
appropriately. AsciiDoxy supports generating documentation that shows how to use elements written in
one language in the other language. It is called "transcoding".

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.language(<language>, source=<source_language>)}
"""}
----

Other languages will be ignored, unless overridden with a `lang` argument. Using the extra `lang`
argument also disables transcoding. This setting also applies to all files included afterwards, but
resets and the end of the current file.

`language`:: Language to use for all following insert and link directives.
`source`:: Language to transcode elements from if the element cannot be found for `language`.
`None` to disable transcoding.

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.language("kotlin", source="java")} # <1>
${api.language("swift", source="objc")} # <2>
${api.language("java", source=None)}   # <3>
"""}
----
<1> Insert elements as Kotlin elements. Transcode from Java if the element is not found.
<2> Insert elements as Swift elements. Transcode from Objective C if the element is not found.
<3> Disable transcoding, use Java as default language.

== Search namespace

By default AsciiDoxy searches for API elements using their fully qualified name. For languages that
support namespaces, a search namespace can be set to start looking for elements using a relative
name. The `${api.link("Api.namespace", text="api.namespace")}` sets the search namespace.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.namespace(<namespace>)}
"""}
----

`namespace`:: Namespace to start the search from, or `None` to reset.

AsciiDoxy tries to search the same way the program language would. It searches the selected
namespace, but also every namespace above it, until it finds a match. This includes the root
namespace if nothing is found earlier.

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.namespace("org.asciidoxy.parser")}  # <1>
${api.namespace("asciidoxy::example")}    # <2>
${api.namespace(None)}                    # <3>
"""}
----
<1> Search in the Java package `org.asciidoxy.parser`.
<2> Search in the {cpp} namespace `asciidoxy::exmaple`.
<3> Only allow fully qualified names from now on.

== Required version

Your documentation may require features of a specific version of AsciiDoxy. It may also use features
that are changed in a future version. To make sure your documentation is always generated with a
compatible version of AsciiDoxy, you can specify a required version or version range.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.require_version(<specifier>)}
"""}
----

`specifier`:: One or more comma-separated version specifiers matching the PEP 440 standard.

The version specifiers follow https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/[PEP 440], which is the same
standard for specifying python package versions installed with pip.

=== Examples

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.require_version("==0.5.3")}       # <1>
${api.require_version("~=0.5.3")}       # <2>

are allowed, but minor and major increments are not.
<3> Require version 0.5.3 and any newer version, including versions with breaking changes.
<4> Require version 0.5.3 and above, but below version 0.7.

== Multi-page table of contents

In multi-page mode the table of contents generated by AsciiDoctor only contains the sections for
each specific page. The contents of other pages in the tree are not visible. You can add an extra
table of contents listing each separate page.

[source,python]
----
${"""
${api.multipage_toc([side=<left/right>])}
"""}
----

`side`:: Side of the page to put the table of contents, similar to the AsciiDoc option. Defaults to
the left side.

In the table of contents, only the first document title encountered in each AsciiDoc file is used.
For documents having multiple titles, like the book type, the other titles are ignored.

It can be combined with the normal AsciiDoctor table of contents. If both tables are configured to
appear on the same side, they will hide eachother, so make sure you choose different sides.

The command should be included in the document header. If that is not possible, make sure the
document header contains at least:

${"""
${api.multipage_toc()}              # <1>
