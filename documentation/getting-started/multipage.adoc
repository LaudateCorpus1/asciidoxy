The HTML output from AsciiDoctor is limited to a single HTML page. You can separate your document
into multiple AsciiDoc files and use `include::` to combine them, but this will result in a single
large HTML file. Alternatively, you can create multiple AsciiDoc files and run AsciiDoctor
separately on each file. This does create multiple HTML files, and you can even link between these
files. However, it does not provide structured navigation between the files, and manual work is
required to generate a single PDF version of the same documentation.

AsciiDoxy removes these limitations by introducing multipage mode. You can generate single HTML or
PDF files in single page mode, and generate multiple HTML documetns in multipage mode. All from the
same AsciiDoc source files.

== Structuring your multipage document [[structure]]

AsciiDoxy copies the input files to a temporary location where it can modify them. This is required
to process the included python code. To be able to include, and refer to, other files, you need to
tell AsciiDoxy where these files are. AsciiDoxy will then copy these files to the temporary location
as well.

Let's start by creating a directory with 2 AsciiDoc files:

. Create a directory called `src`. This will be the directory used by AsciiDoxy to find all files.
. In the `src` directory create a file called `index.adoc`. This will be the entry point for the
  generated documentation.
. In the `src` directory create another file called `reference.adoc`. This will be the second page
  of the documentation.

Run AsciiDoxy on these files:

[source,bash]
----
asciidoxy --base-dir src src/index.adoc
----

The result will be a single, mostly empty file: `build/output/index.html`.

== Including another file

Let's first add some content to `src/reference.adoc`:

[source]
----
= Reference

This is the reference file.
----

Then add the following content to `src/index.adoc`:

[source]
----
= Documentation

This is the entry point of the documentation.

${"""${api.include("reference.adoc")}"""}
----

The last line is AsciiDoxy's version of `include::`. Similar to the normal `include::` this tells
AsciiDoxy that you want to include the contents of another file here in the document. However, in a
moment you will see that this version can do much more.

Run AsciiDoxy again:

[source,bash]
----
asciidoxy --base-dir src src/index.adoc
----

The result will look something like this:

====
[discrete]
= Documentation

This is the entry point of the documentation.

[discrete]
== Reference

This is the reference file.
====

This is still the same result as using AsciiDoctor with `include::`! However, the result will be
different when using AsciiDoxy in multipage mode:

[source,bash]
----
asciidoxy --base-dir src --multipage src/index.adoc
----

There will now be 2 files: `src/index.html` and `src/reference.html`. The first one will look like
this:

====
[discrete]
= Documentation

This is the entry point of the documentation.

<<multipage.adoc#,reference.adoc>>
====

The link called `reference.adoc` will take you to a file containing only the contents of
`reference.adoc`. Both pages will also have a navigation bar at the bottom. With the navigation bar
you can easily jump between pages.

== Improving what the link looks like

By default AsciiDoxy uses the name of the included file for the link text. A nicer text can be
provided using the `link_text` argument:

[source]
----
${"""
${api.include("reference.adoc", link_text="Reference documentation")}
"""}
----

The result is:

====
<<multipage.adoc#,Reference documentation>>
====

A link prefix can be used to insert text before the link, e.g. to create a list of links. This text
will only be inserted in multipage mode. In singlepage mode the contents of the file are inserted.

[source]
----
${"""
${api.include("reference.adoc", link_text="Reference documentation", link_prefix=". ")}
"""}
----

====
. <<multipage.adoc#,Reference documentation>>
====

[TIP]
====
For more options, see the documentation for
${api.cross_document_ref("../reference/commands.adoc", anchor="api_include", link_text="api.include")}.
====

== Cross references between pages

In multipage mode, the usual AsciiDoc cross references between different files no longer work as
expected. AsciiDoctor relies on having all references in the same output file. When the target of
the cross reference is in a different output file, the cross reference needs to be adapted.

AsciiDoxy can generate the correct cross references for both singlepage and multipage mode. Instead
of `<<...>>` or `xref:...[]`, you need to use `${"${api.cross_document_ref(...)}"}`.

In the document structure from <<structure,section 1>> we can add the following to
`src/reference.adoc` to refer to the main document:

[source]
----
${"""
${api.cross_document_ref("index.adoc", link_text="Back home")}
"""}
----

====
${api.cross_document_ref("multipage.adoc", link_text="Back home")}
====

Optionally, you can provide an anchor to link to. For example in `src/index.adoc`:

[source]
----
${"""
${api.cross_document_ref("reference.adoc", anchor="_reference", link_text="Reference")}
"""}
----

====
${api.cross_document_ref("multipage.adoc", anchor="_reference", link_text="Reference")}
====

[TIP]
====
For more options, see the documentation for
${api.cross_document_ref("../reference/commands.adoc", anchor="cross_referencing",
                         link_text="api.cross_document_ref")}.
====

== More to come...

The AsciiDoxy documentation is still being written. Expect more documentation about:

 * Hiding multipage links
 * Showing a multipage table of contents
 * ...
