== Could not fully parse ... Links to known types may be missing.

AsxiiDoxy needs to perform some parsing to create links in compound types. For example for types
like: `MyContainer<MyType, MyAllocator>`. It will try to create links to `MyContainer`, `MyType`,
and `MyAllocator`. Sometimes it fails to parse the full type. In that case a warning is shown and
the generated documentation may not show links to all known types.

When this happens, please open https://github.com/tomtom-international/asciidoxy/issues[an issue on
GitHub] with the following information:

* A minimal sample of source code that triggers the warning.
* The Doxygen configuration and version used to create the XML input.
* The version of AsciiDoxy used.
* Log output when running AsciiDoxy with `--log DEBUG`.
